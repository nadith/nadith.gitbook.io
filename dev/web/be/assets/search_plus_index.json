You need to remember that Node JS is not a framework and it’s not a programming language. Most of the people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on. ExpressJS: Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node JS’s web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node JS’s HTTP objects. It facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects. Node JS is a platform for building i/o applications that are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript. Express JS is a framework based on Node JS which is used for building web applications using approaches and principles of Node JS event-driven architecture. Feature Express JS Node JS Usage It is used to build web-apps using approaches and principles of Node JS It is used to build server-side, input-output, event-driven apps.

    "title": "2.1 Pub",
    "keywords": "jsframework",
    "url": "/dev/web/be/jsframework/2_1_pug/",
    "body": "Introduction Why pub? As web designers or developers, we likely all have to write our fair share of HTML. And while this is not the most difficult task, it can often feel a little boring or repetitive. This is where the Pug HTML preprocessor comes in. HTML is also static, which means that if you want to display dynamic data (fetched from an API, for example), you invariably end up with a mishmash of HTML stings inside JavaScript. This can be a nightmare to debug and to maintain. Pug is a template engine for Node and for the browser. It compiles to HTML and has a simplified syntax, which can make you more productive and your code more readable. Pug makes it easy both to write reusable HTML, as well as to render data pulled from a database or API. History It’s also worth noting that Pug used to be called Jade until it was forced to change its name due to a trademark claim in 2015. The name change took effect with version 2.0. What is pug used for A template engine is a program which is responsible for compiling a template (that can be written using any one of a number of languages) into HTML. The template engine will normally receive data from an external source, which it will inject into the template it’s compiling. This is illustrated by the following diagram. Example doctype html html(lang='en') head title Hello, World! body h1 Hello, World! div.remark p Pug rocks! Rendered output &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div class=\"remark\"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pug rocks!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; DOCTYPE You can use Pug to generate a number of document type declarations. For example doctype html will compile to &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, the standard HTML5 doctype, whereas doctype strict will give us &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt;. Pug will do its best to ensure that its output is valid for the document type. Tags As mentioned, Pug doesn’t have any closing tags and relies on indentation for nesting. This might take a small amount of getting used to, but once you do, it makes for clean and readable code. By way of an example: nav navbar-default div h1 My Website! ul li a Home li a Page 1 li a Page 2 input Rendered output &lt;nav&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;My Website!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Page 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;input/&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; TIP Notice that Pug is smart enough to close any self-closing tags (such as the &lt;input /&gt; element) for us. Classes, IDs and Attributes Classes and IDs are expressed using a .className and #IDname notation. For example: nav#navbar-default div.container-fluid h1.navbar-header My Website! Pug also offers us a handy shortcut. If no tag is specified, it will assume a &lt;div&gt; element: nav#navbar-default .container-fluid h1.navbar-header My Website! Both of these compile to: &lt;nav id=\"navbar-default\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"container-fluid\"&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"navbar-header\"&gt;My Website!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; Attributes are added using brackets: ul li a(href='/') Home li a(href='/page-1') Page 1 li a(href='/page-2') Page 2 input.search( type='text' name='search' placeholder='Enter a search term...' ) This results in the following: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/page-1\"&gt;Page 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/page-2\"&gt;Page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;input class=\"search\" type=\"text\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Enter a search term...\"/&gt; Test"
